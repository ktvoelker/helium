Fix line comment parsing

Fix block comment parsing

  Empty block comments don't work right

  Nested block comments must have a character between the opening of the outer and
  inner comments

  The reason for all of this is that the blockCommentContent parser can't be allowed
  to match nothing, because then we match it forever and make no progress

    We need to construct a fairly complex regex to match the content properly.
    Instead of using anyChar, it will use "anyChar but the first char of the
    block comment opening phrase, or the first char of that phrase not followed
    by the second char of that phrase, or the first two chars not followed by
    the third" and so on.

Rename everything into Text.Junco and Data.Junco
